Toy Author Status Inquiry System - A coding exercise for software developer candidates

We want to implement a simple author inquiry system for authors to view the status of their submitted manuscripts.

### Requirements

* A running MongoDB Server (http://www.mongodb.org) - Install if necessary.
* Ruby 2.2

### Setup Instructions

* Clone the repo
* Install the bundle (bundler)
* Seed the database ```rake db:setup``` - The database is populated with the following manuscript from ```db/seeds.rb``` via Mongoid.
  <pre>
    Manuscript.create(code: 'AA1001', title: 'My awesome paper', status: 'WITH_AUTHOR', :status_date => Date.parse('01Jan2014')) do |m|
      m.authors << Author.new(publish_name: 'Smith,Joe')
      m.authors << Author.new(publish_name: 'Li,Wen')
      m.authors << Author.new(publish_name: 'Jones,Ben')
    end
  </pre>
* Start the application (standard Rails)
* Visit http://localhost:3000/admin/manuscripts to confirm the app is up and running.
  You should see a crude looking page that shows info about the above manuscript(s).
  
Please note, the ```/admin``` namespace is just there to verify basic sanity and is not where your code should go. The features you are adding are intended to be used by authors wanting to view the status of their papers.
